## Python

The core of fast pro

## MATLAB

Very convenient for research. Optimization, Machine Learning, Robotics and other packages are waitnig for you 

## C++

The

You should know Standard Template Library. Basically, it is efficient implementation of common data structures and algorithms. [Check out](../algorithms/) what algorithms and data structures you should know.

## C

Want to rule hardware? C is the right choice for you. Motor drivers, microcontrollers

You will have to master memory management. So, pointers and malloc should become

If you want to use the power of GPU's parallel computation, you can go with CUDA
