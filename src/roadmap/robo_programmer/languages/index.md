# Programming Languages

::: block Quote
A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing Â© **Alan Perlis**

## Python

The core of fast prototyping, Machine Learning, Backend development and other cool things

Easy to get started: no types, no braces, no need to compile

Python has many great data science related libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Pytorch, OpenCV

Python can be used for [API creation](../../robo_integrator/api/): Flask, Django, FastAPI

## MATLAB

Very convenient for research. Optimization Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, Robotics Toolbox and other packages are waitnig for you

## C++

Your choice when you need to have something performing blazing-fast

You should know the **S**tandard **T**emplate **L**ibrary (STL). Basically, it is efficient implementation of common data structures and algorithms. [Check out](../algorithms/) what algorithms and data structures it's good to know

Here are several must-know concepts for a C++ programmer:

- Program Compilation and Linking, Dynamic Libraries
- C++ memory model
- Move Semantics
- The rule of three (five)
- RAII
- Smart Pointers
- Iterator Invalidation
- Polymorphism, Inheritance, Virtual Methods
- Overloading, Operator overloading
- Templates

## C

Want to rule hardware? C is the right choice for you. Motor drivers, microcontrollers

You will have to master memory management. So, pointers and malloc should become your friends

If you want to use the power of GPU's parallel computation, you can go with CUDA
