## Test Driven Development

If you're doing something more serious than a pet-project, you should write tests. Tests are the way for programmers to underwrite their work

Check out this [list](https://u-tor.com/topic/the-most-expensive-software-bugs-in-history) of the most expensive bugs in history to see what that "teeny-tiny bugsy" can lead to

Uncle Bob proposes three rules of TDD:

- **Write production code only to pass a failing unit test**
- **Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures)**
- **Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test**

They may seem like overkill, but by following the rules you will always be at most within 5 minutes from fully operational software and will never learn how to use a debugger. Actually, "Great debugging skills" should never appear in your CV
