## Touch typing

The easiest way to boost your productivity is to type with ten fingers

Here are a couple of websites to practice your typing:

- [Touch Typing Exercises](https://www.typingclub.com/)
- [Typing Practice For Programmers](https://typing.io/)

## Working Environment

You should have an environment where you feel comfortable

## IDE

Modern IDEs like VSCode and JetBrains products are a great choice. They provide linting, spell checking, autoformatting, syntax highlighting and many other useful things to boost your efficiency

It is also recommended to know how to use terminal tools like Vim and Emacs. Helps in the situation when you have to do some stuff on a remote server

## Jupyter Notebooks

You can use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive experiments. They are the best when you're tinkering with datasets and exploring new things

Notebooks also provide you with the ability to write markdown documentation. This is great for hands-on tutorials and explanations

::: block Pro Tip

### Dotfiles

What if I told you, your programming toolbox can always be with you, regardless of the machine you're using
