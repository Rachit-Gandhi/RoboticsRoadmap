## Data Structures

We should know how to treat the most precious resource we have - data

The problem is, data can be used in different ways. For example, consider an array of numbers:

- You might need to access it sequentially, or you should be able to compare pairs of numbers
- You might have limited memory or limited computing power, or both
- What happens if you need to add items from your array?
- What happens if you need to remove items from your array?

Data Structures will teach you how to satisfy your requirements

## Algorithms

Ok, now we can access the data efficiently. Time to process it. Algorithms teach us how to process data to get the desired results

## Complexity Analysis

Every data structure and every algorithm have their strengths and weaknesses

You can utilize Big-O notation - mathematical way of describing performance of data structures and algorithms

## Whiteboard Coding

Very common practice on coding interviews these days. The task is to solve a programming problem using a whiteboard instead of an IDE
