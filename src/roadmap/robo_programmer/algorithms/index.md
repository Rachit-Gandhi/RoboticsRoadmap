## Data Structures

We should know how to treat the most precious resource we have - data

The problem is, data is used in different ways. For example, consider an array of numbers.

You might need to access it sequentially

And what happens if you need to add or remove items from your array?

Data Structures will teach you have to manage

## Algorithms

Ok, now we can access the data efficiently. Time to process it. Algorithms teach us how to process data.

## Complexity Analysis

Every data structure and every algorithm have their strengths and weaknesses.
