## Version Control Systems

Why should you use a VCS? Here is why:

```
project_folder:
├─ program.py
├─ program_backup.py
├─ program_backup_1.py
├─ program_backup_2.py
├─ program_old.py
├─ program_final.py
├─ program_final_v2.py
└─ program_with_feature.py
```

Git is the most widely used VCS, but you should be aware of CVS, SVN and Mercurial

[GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) can help you with hosting you repositories with code. This comes in handy when you're working in a team and need to share a codebase. One of the most common practices when working with Git is called Gitflow

## Code style

- Should I use two or four spaces, or tab is better?
- Should I not exceed 80 symbols per line?
- Should I use multiline comments for documentation?

The answer is simple: "You should do the same your team does"

In case you need to select a code style for your team, [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) you can find Google code style guides
