## Matrices and their properties

You should know how to manipulate em

## Analytical geometry

If your drawing skills leave much to be desired, analytical geometry will help with defining lines and planes analytically

## Matrix subspaces

Any matrix can be treated as a transformation from one space to another. Knowledge of the properties of four fundamental matrix subspaces might come in handy

## Special Matrices and Factorization

Sometimes it might be beneficial to represent a matrix as a product of several matrices. This can help to speed-up computation, and to uncover hidden structure

Here are some cool matrices:

- Identity matrix
- Diagonal matrices
- Triangular matrices
- Symmetric matrices
- Skew-symmetric matrices
- Orthogonal matrices
- Rotation matrices

## Change of basis

Sometimes it is necessary to have a different perspective on things.
Change of basis can help to find out where

#### Applications

- Computer Vision
- Navigation

## Projections

Projections are like shadows

#### Applications

- Computer Vision
- Optimization

### Eigendecomposition SVD and PCA

Methods to extract the most important information

#### Applications

- Pseudoinverse
- Least squares optimization
- Data compression
- Signal processing
- Recommendation systems
- Face recognition

### Cholesky factorization

The method to speedup numerical calculations and equations solving

#### Applications

- Matrix inversion
- Equation solving
- Newton's method for non-linear optimization
- Kalman filters
- Monte-Carlo simulations
