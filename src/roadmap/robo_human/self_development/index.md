# Self-development

## Food

## Sport

## Habit handling

You can set your goals, but it is more beneficial to set your habits

Here is what I mean

Instead of setting a goal like "I want to loose 10 kg till the end of the year", you should set a habit "I want to visit gym at least three times a week"

Goals can be disappointing if you are not able to reach them. There are factors that are not in your power to change

Goals require self-control and willpower which are periodically exhausted

## Learning skills

It is necessary to stay up to date in IT. New algorithms and approaches are constantly being developed, so easy to fall behind

Lifelong learning is essential
